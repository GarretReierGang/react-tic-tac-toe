This product is my personal solution to the further practice of [React's tic-tac-toe tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) with one additional step added.

Here are the improvements listed :
1. Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in move history list
2. Bold currently selected item in the move list
3. Rewrite board dynamically generate squares instead of hardcoding
4. Add toggle button
5. Highlight winning squares
6. Display draw message when no moves remain
7. Make the board scalable to different board sizes, this includes changing how the victory condition is calculated.

# Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GarretReierGang/react-tic-tac-toe
cd react-tic-tac-toe
npm install
npm start
```
